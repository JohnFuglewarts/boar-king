# Nightfall Arena – Golbus The Gaurdian

Dark Souls-inspired mini boss encounter built in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Kite Golbus, a spined sentinel wielding twin razored claws and relentless speed, wait for volatile bombs to manifest, and crush its health bar with well-timed detonations.

## How to play

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you don’t already have it.
2. In a terminal, change into this folder and run `npm start` to launch the local server.
3. Visit [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) in your browser, click inside the window to lock focus, then dodge for dear life.
4. Survive long enough for bombs to spawn; brush against a bomb as it streaks past to ignite it automatically.

### Controls

- **Move:** WASD or Arrow keys
- **Sprint:** Hold **Shift**
- **Detonate bomb:** Just touch a bomb (press **Space** for an optional manual trigger)

### Mechanics

- Bombs roll every 10 seconds with a 50% chance to appear, then rocket around the arena. Any contact detonates them—line up Golbus inside the blast radius for massive damage.
- Golbus mixes lightning lunges, tornado claw swipes, jagged shard volleys, and short-fuse shadow eruptions to keep you guessing—each phase now fires faster with tighter telegraphs.
- Your blade can’t harm this guardian; bombs remain the only way to break its shell.

### Strategy tips

- Bait lunges, cut hard to the side, then herd Golbus toward the next speeding bomb.
- Watch the claw wind-up—if the arms flare wide, be ready to dash through the gap before they scissor shut.
- Volleys now lead their target; weave unpredictably and use sprint bursts to throw off their aim.
- Shadow eruptions telegraph with crimson rings. Dash outside the circle before detonation.

After victory or defeat, hit **Rise Again** to retry instantly. Embrace the darkness, study the patterns, and bring down Golbus The Gaurdian.
